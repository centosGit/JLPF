EyeDroid: Gaze tracking component for Android
========

Background

Gaze-based interaction techniques are among the most interesting touchless interaction techniques for mobile and wearable systems. 
However, most of the existing technologies for gaze-tracking require a remote computer to process the gaze data and gaze 
interaction with a user interface. Designing and developing an unobtrusive and mobile gaze tracker could be a valuable technology 
for users of mobile and wearable devices.

Description

Develop a monocular camera-based gaze tracking system on Android which receives image of the eye from a usb or wireless camera 
and calculates the gaze point in a 2D surface. The gaze information can be sent to other mobile or wearable devices in real-time 
through bluetooth or WIFI network.

Technology: Android, OpenCV
